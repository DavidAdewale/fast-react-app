# Fast React Pizza App (Complete)

This app has the following feature requirements: <br/>
✅ Very simple application, where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu <br/>
✅ Requires no user accounts and no login; users just input their names before using the app <br/>
✅ The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API <br/>
✅ Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering <br/>
✅ Ordering requires just the user's name, phone number, and address <br/>
✅ If possible, GPS location should be provided, to make delivery easier <br/>
✅ User's can mark their order as priority for an additional 20% of the cart price <br/>
✅ Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user datat + selected pizzas) to the API <br/>
✅ Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app <br/>
✅ Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID <br/>
✅ Users should be able to mark their order as priority order even after it has been placed
